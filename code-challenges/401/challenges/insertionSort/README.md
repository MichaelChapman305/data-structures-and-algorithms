# Challenge Summary
Write a function called insertionSort which takes an array, sorts it with insertion sort, and returns the sorted array.

## Challenge Description
Implement insertion sort, a sorting algorithm which compares each element in the array to the element on its left, swapping places with the element on it's left if it meets the criteria, and keeps going until the array is fully sorted. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I will be utilizing a for loop inside of a while loop, keeping track of the elements using a temp variable and comparing arr[i] with arr[i+1] swapping elements where necessary
